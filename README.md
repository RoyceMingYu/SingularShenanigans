========================

The **MacViewer** is an alternative implementation of the [KanColleTool Viewer](https://github.com/KanColleTool/kct-viewer) for Mac OS X.

This is necessary because Flash Player currently doesn't work properly with QtWebKit there, the reason being that they started disregarding the NPAPI spec in a way that it doesn't like.
Now effectively dead, just uploaded for the memories until someone comes back and fixes the issues.
